In this Program, you will write a program that will use a for loop to ask for the total rainfall in inches for each of 12 months into an array of doubles.  Create a parallel array for the names of the months.  Within this for loop use a while loop to validate the data. Create functions with function prototypes to calculate and neatly display the rainfall in inches to 2 decimal places. Use block comments with the functions. Use the following function prototypes:
    • double getTotal(double []);			
    • double getAverage(double []);		
    • double getHighest(double [], int &);		int & is the reference parameter for subscript
    • double getLowest(double [], int &);		for either highest or lowest rainfall month.
Display the following data using iomanip like the sample output on the next page:
    • The total rainfall in inches for the year.
    • The average monthly rainfall in inches for the year.
    • The month and the rainfall in inches for the highest amount of rainfall.
    • The month and the rainfall in inches for the lowest amount of rainfall.
Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for monthly rainfall figures.
